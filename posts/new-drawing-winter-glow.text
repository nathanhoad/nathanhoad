I just added another wallpaper to my [Deviant Art profile](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com). It is a vector piece titled ['Winter Glow'](http://nathanhoad.deviantart.com/art/Winter-Glow-92890382) and was drawn using Inkscape.

I'm not sure where the inspiration for this one came from; It is winter here but it isn't snowing and it certainly isn't glowing .
