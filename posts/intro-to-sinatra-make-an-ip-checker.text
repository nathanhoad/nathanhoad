# Intro to Sinatra - Make an IP Checker

In case you haven't chanced upon it already, [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) is a lightweight Ruby framework. It's perfect for simple one-function kinds of web applications that don't require the complexities of Rails. Getting started with Sinatra is easy and for this quick example we will be making a very simple app - one that will tell us what our IP address is.

Let's get things started by installing the Sinatra gem:

    sudo gem install sinatra

Now we need a project folder that we can keep all our stuff in:

    mkdir ip-checker
    cd ip-checker

Then create an 'app.rb' file with this in it:

    #! Ruby
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sinatra'
    
    # This tells Sinatra to respond to the default route
    get '/' do
      "Hello World"
    end

The "Hello World" is there just for testing at the moment; we will do something more interesting soon. Now, make sure everything is ok so far by using Sinatra's built-in development server. Just run:

    ruby app.rb

And then go to [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) (4567 being the default port of the server) and you will see "Hello world". Go back to Terminal and kill the server by pressing Ctrl+C.

With me so far? No? Surely you meant yes... Yes? That's better 

Now we want to actually do something useful - check our IP. We will be using [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) for our templates so we will need to get it installed:

    sudo gem install haml

Then we need to require it in our app (on the line after we required Sinatra before):

    #! Ruby
    require 'haml'
    
This next line is optional; it just tells HAML to use HTML5 tags. Add this just after the `require 'haml'`:

    #! Ruby
    set :haml, { :format => :html5 }

Now we can modify our default route to add the IP checking code:
    
    #! Ruby
    get '/' do
      # Grab the users IP
      @ip = request.env['REMOTE_ADDR'].split(',').first
      # Render our Index template
      haml :index
    end
    
Before we can run this we need to make our Index template. Create a new folder inside our project folder called 'views'. Now in our views folder we can create our Index view. Name it 'index.haml' and put this inside of it:

    #! HAML
    !!! Strict
    %html
      %head
        %title
          Your IP is
          = @ip    
        %link{:rel => "shortcut icon", :type => "image/png", :href => "/favicon.png"}/
        %link{:rel => "stylesheet", :type => "text/css", :href => "/stylesheets/application.css"}/
    
      %body
        %h1
          Your IP is
          %em
            = @ip
    
If you are unfamiliar with HAML don't worry too much - all you need to notice is the '@ip' references. They are the same as the '@ip' that we defined back in 'app.rb'.

If everything has gone to plan so far we should now have a semi-useful app. Try running it again with `ruby app.rb` and see for yourself.

So that wraps it up for this super simple intro to Sinatra. Now you've got no excuse not to try it out
