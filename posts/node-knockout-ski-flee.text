Over the weekend just gone I, along with [Lilly Piri](https://lillypiri.com) and [Ben Hoad](http://benhoad.net), 
competed in [Node Knockout](https://www.nodeknockout.com/), a global 48 hour hackathon.

The rules are simple - you have 48 hours (the same 48 hours worldwide) to make a Node app. We had been wanting to have 
a go at making a [Phaser](http://phaser.io) game and had recently managed to get [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) 
working so we figured a simple game would make a great project.

The result of our (not quite sleepless) weekend is [Ski Flee](https://ski.littlenebula.com)

Inspired by Ski Free from back in the ancient Windows days we decided to make an (almost) endless runner style game
where you simply dodge trees, try to pass through gates, and all the while avoiding the dreaded yeti.
