I just uploaded a quick teaser I made a few years ago for a [Kings College](http://kings.uq.edu.au) Conclusion. I was asked to make a quick video to share around the colleges at [UQ](http://www.uq.edu.au) that would advertise the tropicana themed party.

The clip didn't take that long to make, mostly because a fair chunk of the work was already done. The wyvern was recycled from the Kings Tonight intro and most of the girls in the background are just the same person duplicated with a few colour changed here and there
